---

### Before Redshift - Traditional Data Warehouses

- Time consuming to pull data from many sources using traditional architecture
- Costly - hardware, setup, electricity, security, estate
- Maintenance costs often outweighed the benefits (upgrading systems due to more data being added)
- Performance issues
- Auto-scaling is not an easy concept

---

### Discussion (5 mins)

> What is a data warehouse?
>
> Why would we use it?

Notes:
Prompt the learners for their idea of a warehouse - what is kept in a warehouse?

Create an analogy - it's where a business typically stores the finished goods ready to be sent to other places or sold

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores and consolidates data from multiple sources, enabling businesses to analyze it for better decision-making and business intelligence.

---

### Data Warehousing

- It intends to be where you keep your best data - the source of truth for your business
- It has been cleaned and transformed in preparation for storage
- Highly structured data that is ready for analysis

Notes:
Keep the analogy going on how the students have already been doing this through their ETL pipeline in their team project

In a following session we will talk more on warehousing

---

### Redshift

- Massively **parallel**, **column-oriented** database
- Simple and cost-effective to analyse your data
- Manages, monitors and scales your system
- Up to 10x better performance than traditional
- Collection of compute resources which are called nodes
- These nodes, when organised into groups, become **clusters**
- Each cluster runs a Redshift engine which contains one or more DBs

Notes:
Parallel: Redshift architecture is designed as a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) system, meaning it distributes data and workload across multiple nodes for parallel processing.

Column orientated = stores data by column rather than row. Faster to query a subset of columns versus usually less efficient at inserting data.

---

### Architecture

RedShift operates a complex model under the hood:

![](img/redshift_simpler_architecture.png)<!-- .element: class="centered"  -->

Notes:

The cluster that composes the redshift engine is made up of multiple nodes - a leader that is chosen to talk to the outside as an API, and compute nodes.

### Architecture

Sample data

![](img/redshift_sample_data.png)<!-- .element: class="centered"  -->

Notes:
Our data can be composed of many databases which contain many tables

---

### Architecture

Sharding

![](img/redshift_data_sharding.png)<!-- .element: class="centered"  -->

Notes:
If we load redshift with our databases it then shards the data automatically across the many nodes for performance. (This is not something we have to worry about to configure)

---

### Clusters

- A cluster has a leader node with one or more compute nodes
- The leader node receives queries from client applications (BI, analytical software etc.)

Notes:
It develops a suitable query execution plan and coordinates parallel executions of these plans with one or more compute nodes.

Once the compute nodes finish, the leader aggregates the results from the nodes and sends back a response to the client application.

---

### Compute Nodes

- Compute resources which execute a query plan
- Transmits data among themselves to solve queries
- Nodes are further divided into (node) slices
- Each node slice receives an allocation of memory and performs operations in parallel

---

### Node types

- When you launch a (non-free tier) cluster, you need to specify the node types
- There are several types of node you can pick, including:
    - RA3
    - DC2 (Dense Compute)
    - DS2 (Dense Storage - _Legacy_)

Notes:

The node type determines the CPU, RAM, storage capacity, and storage drive type for each node.

Slides previously covered DC2 (Dense Compute) vs DS2 (Dense Storage) nodes.

However, AWS have released RA3 nodes which separates compute and storage costs, and are recommended by AWS over DS2 in all instances.

How to pick node type on next slide.

---

### Choosing the right nodes:

- **Data Quantity:** Be aware of the amount of data you want to import into your Redshift cluster
- **Complexity of queries:** Different nodes support queries with differing levels of complexity
- **Downstream systems:** What uses the results of the queries? How important is query speed?

Notes:
Current recommendation (2023):

Less than 1 TB of data -> DC2 nodes.

Most other situations -> RA3 nodes. However, you still choose number of nodes and volume of managed storage.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html

---

### Columnar Data Storage

- The data is still represented with rows and columns as normal
- However, the data is physically stored by column, instead of rows
- Because the data stored is the same type, you can achieve better data compression
- Number of I/O operations decreases
- Also means you can query/perform data analysis on similar types of data far quicker than row storage

### Quiz Time! 🤓

- TODO

### Proposed Pipeline Architecture

Let's revisit our Mystery Shopper target setup:

### Our next user story

`As a` SuperCafe senior manager

`I want` the Mystery Shopper data to be analysed

`So that` we can award the friendliest most helpful store a prize each month

---

### Our next user story - Architecture

We want to check our data is going into the database, so that we can query it. We don't need the Grafana VM yet:

### Our next user story - Architecture

So for now we only need this chain of parts to be working:

### Wait, no new CF templating?

> This session does not involve new CloudFormation _per-se_ - rather, using tools already in our toolbox, we connect to RedShift, add data, and query it.
>
> The ETL Lambda python code provided in this session has been extended to talk to RedShift for us.

---

### Quiz Time! 🤓

---

**A colleague in your development team has asked for the database password to connect to a database in RedShift. These credentials are stored in AWS Parameter Store. Which of the following is the best course of action to give the credentials?**

1. Copy and paste the password in a message via teams then delete the message
1. Tell the colleague to write code to log the password then remove the code after they've copied the password from the logs
1. Direct the colleague to AWS Parameter Store to access the password from there
1. Direct the colleague to AWS Secrets Manager to access the password from there

Answer: `3`<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
Passwords should never leave Parameter Store.
AWS Secrets Manager is also a valid credential storage service - and would be used in many production systems - we're using something simpler for illustration.

---

### Exercise time

Now we've learned a little bit about Amazon Redshift, let's implement loading some data from the Mystery Shopper pipeline into a database hosted on a Redshift cluster.

> Breakouts will be in each Project Team.

---

### Demo - new lambda code

We need to deploy the updated lambda code.

> Instructor to show the new lambda code.
>
> Especially important is the use of Parameter Store to get the connection details.

- See [./handouts/src/mystery_shop_etl_lambda.py](./handouts/src/mystery_shop_etl_lambda.py)
- And [./handouts/src/utils/db_utils.py](./handouts/src/utils/db_utils.py)
- And [./handouts/src/utils/sql_utils.py](./handouts/src/utils/sql_utils.py)

---

### Exercise Prep: Your team name

Your team name will be provided by the instructors. It will have dashes in it (`-`) due to limitations in AWS (esp. Bucket names).

E.g if your team name is "La Vida Mocha", your logical team name will be `la-vida-mocha`.

You will need this!

> Note the dashes!

---

### Demo - Parameter Store settings

The RedShift connection details will be in a Parameter Store param called `<team_name>_redshift_settings`, e.g.`la_vida_mocha_redshift_settings`, as Redshift likes underscores (`_`).

> Instructor to show each team their Parameter Store settings, e.g.`la_vida_mocha_redshift_settings`.

Notes:

These parameter store parameters are populated in advance by your instructor

---

### Demo - the Deploy script - 5 mins

> The deploy scripts `deploy.sh` and `deploy.ps1` in the [./handouts/](./handouts/) folder are done for you, so they will reliably work.
>
> Instructor to show one of the files.

It does the following:

- Collects `aws-profile` and `team-name` from the command line
- Deploy a stack called `team-name-shopper-deployment-bucket`
- Install the Lambda's dependencies in the `src` folder
- Package the `team-name-shopper-etl-pipeline` stack with Lambda Zip in S3
- Deploy a stack called `team-name-shopper-etl-pipeline`

_Image on next slide_

Notes:
Briefly demo the file, show the `aws cloudformation XYZ` command(s)

- for MacOS / WSLv2 / Unix use [./handouts/deploy.sh](./handouts/deploy.sh)
- For Windows Powershell use [./handouts/deploy.ps1](./handouts/deploy.ps1)

---

### Demo - the Deploy script - 5 mins

Here's what the script will deploy:

![AWS-Deployment-script-full-stack-cfn-deployables](./img/AWS-Deployment-script-full-stack-cfn-deployables.png)

Notes:
Briefly discuss how the illustration matches the deploy.sh|ps1

---

### Demo - the Deploy script - 5 mins

Here's the diagram again with the interactions on it:

![AWS-Deployment-script-full-stack-cfn-with-interactions](./img/AWS-Deployment-script-full-stack-cfn-with-interactions.png)

Notes:
Briefly discuss how the illustration shows how the components are deployed and how they interact

---

### Exercise - Step 01 - Deploying

> 15 mins breakout
>
> Only ONE person should do this with the rest of the team watching...
> ...have a think about why!

- Follow [Exercise Step 01 - Deploying](./exercises/aws-07-cfn-redshift-breakout-steps.md)
- Deploy the new lambda code using your team name e.g. `la-vida-mocha` (lower case with dashes)
- Use the relevant `./deploy.[sh|ps1]` script

Notes:
Because a shared stack must be defined only once.

See the exercise file for details!

- for MacOS / WSLv2 / GitBash use [./handouts/deploy.sh](./handouts/deploy.sh)
- For Windows Powershell use [./handouts/deploy.ps1](./handouts/deploy.ps1)

---

### Discussion - Step 01 - Deploying

> How did the deployment go?
>
> Is everyone happy they understand it?

- Why could only **ONE** person from each Team do this?

Notes:
Because a shared stack must be defined only once

---

### Exercise - Step 02 - Trigger lambda

> 5 mins breakout

- Follow [Exercise Step 02 - Trigger lambda](./exercises/aws-07-dfn-redshift-breakout-steps.md)
- Use file [./handouts/data/mystery_shops_2024-03.csv](./handouts/data/mystery_shops_2024-03.csv)
- You can upload the same file many times, or altered copies of it
- Multiple team members can do this concurrently
    - Why is that?

---

### Discussion - Step 02 - Trigger lambda

> How did the triggering go?
>
> Is everyone happy they understand it?

- Why could multiple people do this at the same time?

---

### Demo - Step 03 - RedShift Query Editor

> The Instructor will now demo how to connect to the RedShift query editor in the AWS Console, using the Parameter Store data, e.g. `la_vida_mocha_redshift_settings`.

---

### Exercise - Step 03 - Create SQL Queries

- 20 mins breakout

> Follow [Exercise Step 03 - Create SQL Queries](./exercises/aws-07-dfn-redshift-breakout-steps.md).
>
> Use the RedShift query editor in the AWS Console.

- You can all do this concurrently (not just one person per team)
- Start with `select * from mystery_shop_visit;` and then see if you can do something more sophisticated

Notes:
    Instructors can find the answers in the Solutions folder

---

### Discussion - Step 03 - Create SQL Queries

> How did the SQL-ing go?
>
> Is everyone happy they understand the queries?

---
