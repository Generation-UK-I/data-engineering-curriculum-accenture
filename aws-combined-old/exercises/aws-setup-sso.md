**Linux**:

Follow the guide which best matches your setup [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html).

### Configuration

1. On a terminal, run `aws configure sso`
1. When it asks for `SSO session name`, enter a reasonable name, such as `de-course`
1. Enter your SSO (_Single Sign-On_) URL (if you don't know it, your instructor will be able to tell you - it will likely be something like `https://<bootcamp-name>.awsapps.com/start#/`)
1. Enter the SSO Region, which should be `eu-west-1`
1. When it asks for _SSO registration scopes_, hit enter
1. A webpage will open asking you to sign into the AWS CLI, click the `*Sign in to AWS CLI*` button
1. Looking back at your terminal, you will see some text which looks something like this:
   > Using the account ID _xxxxxxxxxxxx_
   > The only role available to you is: StudentAccess
   > Using the role name "StudentAccess"
1. When it asks for _CLI default client Region_, enter `eu-west-1`
1. When it asks for _CLI default output format_, enter `json`
1. When it asks for _CLI profile name_, enter the same name as above e.g. `de-course`
1. Check your login works
    1. Run `aws sso login --profile <profile-name>` in your terminal (i.e. use the _CLI profile name_ you entered above)
1. That's all (for now!)

You can log out of your SSO any time by running `aws sso logout` in your terminal.

You can now login any time by running `aws sso login --profile <profile-name>` in your terminal.

### Practice using the CLI

1. On your terminal, check which user you're using to call the AWS operations by running this:
    1. `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile <profile-name>`
1. Get a list of available S3 buckets by running this:
    1. `aws s3 ls --profile <profile-name>`
1. On the Management Console in your browser:
    1. Search for S3 in the services search box at the top of the page
    1. Select S3 from the list of services
    1. Look at the list of available buckets - does this match what you saw in the terminal?

We'll hear more info on what S3 and buckets are soon!
