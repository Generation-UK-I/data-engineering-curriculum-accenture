# AWS 07 - Intro to Amazon Redshift + Redshift with IaC

> These breakouts work best if the project Teams work on it together (so, breakout per project team).

## Breakout steps

Now we've seen a demonstration of deploying our Redshift changes, let's run through it in our project groups.

For each breakout room, nominate a driver to screen share their terminal and AWS console view, and then work through the steps below as a group.

## Your team name

Your team name will have been provided by the instructors, e.g `la-vida-mocha` (with dashes `-`).  Make sure you use that for all the steps below.

## Step 01 - Deploying

> Only ONE person should do this with the rest of the team watching
>
> ...have a think about why!

### Step 01.A - Log into AWS

- Open a terminal in the [handouts](../handouts/) folder
    - If using Windows this can be in Powershell
- Log in depending on your AWS login method
- Run
    - Either `aws sso login --profile <your-profile-name>`
    - or `aws-azure-login --profile <you-profile-name>`
    - or use your alias

### Step 01.B Deploy

- Make sure your terminal is in the [handouts](../handouts/) folder
    - If using Windows this can be in Powershell
- Run the relevant `./deploy.[sh|ps1]` script like this:

```sh
cd handouts # only if not already in that folder

./deploy.[sh|ps1] <aws-profile> <team-name-with-dashes>
# e.g run one of these:
# MacOS / WSLv2 / GitBash
./deploy.sh sot-academy la-vida-mocha
# Windows Powershell
./deploy.ps1 sot-academy la-vida-mocha
```

- Wait until the script has finished updating the stack

This script does the following:

- Updates our SSM parameter environment variable via `etl-stack.yml` changes
- Adds new python code to handle querying the SSM parameter from Parameter Store
- Adds new python code to connect to the redshift database:
    - Creates our our `mystery_shop_visit` table if it doesn't already exist
    - Inserts our transformed data into the table

## Step 02 - Trigger lambda

> Multiple team members can do this concurrently...
>
> ...Why is that?

- Open the `CloudFormation` page in the AWS console and locate your team's stack, e.g `la-vida-mocha-etl-pipeline`
- Find the the `Resources` tab
    - In it, open the link to your S3 `raw-data` bucket, e.g. `la-vida-mocha-shopper-raw-data`
    - Then upload a copy of `mystery_shops_2024-03.csv` from the `handouts/data` folder
- Back the `Resources` tab, click the link to your ETL Lambda, e.g. `la-vida-mocha-shopper-etl-lambda`
- Navigate the lambda user interface to confirm:
    - The new SSM environment variable has been added
    - The lambda code has now been updated to include the redshift logic
    - The lambda was invoked after you dropped the CSV into the `raw-data` bucket
- Open the cloudwatch logs for your lambda and inspect the log output
    - Look for the most recent log stream, and open it
    - Confirm the redshift logic was executed successfully (no errors!)

## Step 03 - Create SQL Queries

Now navigate to the _Amazon Redshift_ web console:

- Click on the running cluster under `Cluster overview` on the main homepage
- Under the `Query data` dropdown on the top right, select `Query in query editor v2`
- There should be a dropdown on the top left named `redshiftcluster-*****`
    - click the three dots on it
    - and select, `Edit connection`, or `Create connection`
- Under `Other ways to connect`, ensure the `Database user name and password` option is selected
- Open the AWS Service Manager console in another browser tab
    - Find the `Parameter Store` in the left bar
    - Navigate to the parameter called `<your-team-name>_redshift_settings` to find your redshift credentials
        - e.g `la_vida_mocha_redshift_settings`
    - You should be able to see your DB name, DB user name and DB password
- Back in the Redshift user interface,
    - Enter the `Database`, `User name` and `Password` values
    - Click `Save`
- Expand the list of databases under the redshift cluster name
    - Click on your DB name
- Expand the list of Tables for your database
- Access your team's table in the list on the left
    - The tables created by your python lambda code can be viewed under `Public > Tables`
    - You can right-click on your table name and choose the menu option "Select table"
- In the main SQL window, have a go at writing and running some sql queries for your `mystery_shop_visit` table,
    - Make sure your team's database is selected in the dropdown at the top next to `redshiftcluster**`.
- Start with `SELECT * FROM mystery_shop_visit;`
- Make a query for "Display Store name by Rating"
    - Some sample SQL could be
        - `SELECT m.store_name, m.overall_score FROM mystery_shop_visit m ORDER BY m.store_name;`
    - And also
        - `SELECT m.store_name, MAX(m.overall_score) AS max_score FROM mystery_shop_visit m GROUP BY m.store_name ORDER BY max_score desc;`

### Optional extra task

> In your own project / exercise time, change your code to do a bulk insert with ['execute_values()'](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extras.html#fast-execution-helpers).

This will be useful for performance in the Team Projects when inserting large amounts of data from multiple files.

You can refer back to the databases session for this.
